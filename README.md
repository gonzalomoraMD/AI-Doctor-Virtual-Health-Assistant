AI Doctor is a virtual healthcare assistant that enables real-time video consultations using WebRTC. It listens to symptoms via speech-to-text (Whisper), analyzes them with GPT-4, recommends medicines using FDA APIs, and speaks the response using Google TTS. An AI-powered avatar enhances the interaction, making it feel like a real doctor.
